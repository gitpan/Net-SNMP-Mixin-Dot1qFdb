NAME
    Net::SNMP::Mixin::Dot1qFdb - mixin class for 802.1-Q switch forwarding
    databases

VERSION
    Version 0.04

SYNOPSIS
      use Net::SNMP;
      use Net::SNMP::Mixin qw/mixer init_mixins/;

      my $session = Net::SNMP->session( -hostname => 'foo.bar.com' );
      $session->mixer('Net::SNMP::Mixin::Dot1qFdb');
      $session->init_mixins();
      snmp_dispatcher()   if $session->nonblocking;
      die $session->error if $session->error;

      foreach my $fdb_entry ( $session->get_dot1q_fdb_entries() ) {
        my $mac     = $fdb_entry->{MacAddress};
        my $fdb_id  = $fdb_entry->{fdbId};
        my $vlan_id = $fdb_entry->{vlanId};
        my $port    = $fdb_entry->{dot1dBasePort};
        my $status  = $fdb_entry->{fdbStatus};

        print "$mac, $fdb_id, $vlan_id, $port, $status\n";
      }

DESCRIPTION
    A Net::SNMP mixin class for forwarding database info of 802.1-Q
    compatible switches. The switches must support parts of the standard
    Q-BRIDGE-MIB.

    Sorry to disappoint you, Cisco isn't standard conform, but you knew this
    already, for sure!

MIXIN METHODS
  @fdb = OBJ->get_dot1q_fdb_entries()
    Returns a list of fdb entries. Every list element is a reference to a
    hash with the following fields and values:

        {
          MacAddress      => 'XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX',
          dot1dBasePort   => Integer,
          fdbId           => Integer,
          vlanId          => Integer,
          fdbStatus       => Integer,
          fdbStatusString => String,
        }

    MacAddress
        MacAddress received, in normalized IEEE form XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX.

    dot1dBasePort
        The receiving bride-port for the MAC address.

    fdbId
        MacAddress is member of the FDB with this fdbId. dot1q bridges
        support many forwarding databases.

    vlanId
        Every fdbId is related to a distinct vlanId.

    fdbStatus
        The status of this entry. The meanings of the values are:

            1 = other
            2 = invalid
            3 = learned
            4 = self
            5 = mgmt

        For more information please see the corresponding Q-BRIDGE-MIB.

    fdbStatusString
        The status of this entry in string form, see above.

INITIALIZATION
  OBJ->_init($reload)
    Fetch the fdb related snmp values from the host. Don't call this method
    direct!

PRIVATE METHODS
    Only for developers or maintainers.

  _fetch_dot1q_fdbid()
    Fetch some columns from the VlanCurrentTable once during object
    initialization. MAC addresses in the forwarding database are related to
    fbd ids and the fbd ids are related to vlan ids by this column.

  _fetch_dot1q_tp_fdb_table()
    Fetch the forwarding databases from the dot1qTpFdbTable once during
    object initialization.

SEE ALSO
    Net::SNMP::Mixin::Dot1dBase for a mapping between ifIndexes and
    dot1dBasePorts.

REQUIREMENTS
    Net::SNMP, Net::SNMP::Mixin
